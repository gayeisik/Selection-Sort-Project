[22,27,16,2,18,6] -> Selection Sort;

----> [22,27,16,2,18,6]

1st-> [2,27,16,22,18,6]
2nd-> [2,6,16,22,18,27]
3rd-> [2,6,16,22,18,27]
4th->[2,6,16,18,22,27]


BigO Notation: n+(n-1)+(n-2)+.....+1=n(n+1)/2=(n^2+n)/2 ---->O(n^2)



Time Complexity;

-->The number 18 is in the middle of the array so time complexity is AVERAGE CASE.



[7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15,6] Write the first 4 steps according to the Selection Sort;

1st-> [2,3,5,8,7,9,4,15,6]
2nd-> [2,3,5,8,7,9,4,15,6]
3rd-> [2,3,4,8,7,9,5,15,6]
4th-> [2,3,4,5,7,9,8,15,6]
